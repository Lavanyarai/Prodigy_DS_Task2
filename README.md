![alt text](<Task2.png>)

## Overview

In this task, the objective is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice. A popular choice for this task is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes variables such as age, gender, fare, class, and whether the passenger survived. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Requirements

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any other Python IDE
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Internet access** (to download the dataset)

## Conclusion

This task aims to demonstrate the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using the Titanic dataset. The provided steps and example code offer a starting point for more complex analyses and insights.
